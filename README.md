# resweep
A simple audio resampler.

# What's this?
Exactly what it says on the tin.

It's not the fastest (That's probably https://github.com/depp/libfresample ) nor the highest quality (there are much better ones listed at http://src.infinitewave.ca/ ), but it is one of the free-est (unlicense) and simplest (~270 LOC as of this writing).

As with many resamplers, this is based on the excellent documentation by Julius Orion Smith III at https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/resample/resample.html , as well as numerous google searches and wikipedia readings.

# What's it for?
I noticed a lack of public domain resamplers. They may exist, but my google-fu is weak.

# How do I use it?
It's not quite ready for use yet. I still need to work on documenting the API and such.
